# LFRic Apps Fab Build Scripts

Make sure you have Fab version 2.3 or later installed (in addition to all
LFRic apps requirements of course).

## Setting up Site- and Platform-specific Settings
The lfric_core repository must contain a setup for the site and platform,
see the documentation in ``lfric_core/lfric_build/README.md``.

## Building the Gravity Wave

In order to build Gravity Wave, change into the directory
```$LFRIC_APPS/applications/gravity_wave```,
and use the following command:

```
./fab_gravity_wave.py --core $LFRIC_CORE --nprocs 4 --site nci --platform gadi \
                      --suite gnu
```
Select an appropriate number of processes to run in parallel, and your site and platform.
If you don't have a default compiler suite in your site-specific setup (or
want to use a non-default suite), use the ``--suite`` option. Once the process is finished,
you should have a binary in the directory
```./fab-workspace/gravity_wave-full-COMPILER``` (where ```COMPILER``` is the compiler
used, e.g. ```mpif90-gfortran```).

Using ```./fab_gravity_wave.py -h``` will show a help message with all supported command line
options (and their default value). If a default value is listed using an environment
variables (```(default: $SITE or 'default')```), the corresponding environment variable
is used if no command line option has been specified.

A different compilation profile can be specified using ```--profile``` option. Note
that the available compilation profiles can vary from site to site (see
[Fab documentation](https://metoffice.github.io/fab/fab_base/config.html) for details).

If Fab has issues finding a compiler, you can use the Fab debug option
```--available-compilers```, which will list all compilers and linkers Fab has
identified as being available.

## Testing with pFUnit

Any application script can additionally inherit from the ``pfunit_mixin.py``
mixin, e.g.:
```
from lfric_apps_base import LFRicAppsBase  # noqa: E402
from pfunit_mixin import PfUnitMixin  # noqa: E402


class FabGravityWave(PfUnitMixin, LFRicAppsBase):

```
This will by default also build any tests in a ``unit-test`` directory.
Additionally, a new command line option ``--no-test`` is added if
building of the tests should be disabled.


## Checking out LFRic Core

The Fab scripts use an object-oriented design, and all application scripts
are based on a base class in LFRic Core. It is therefore required to have
LFRic core checked out before an application can be build (the scripts will
check out all other dependencies from the ``dependencies.yaml`` file
automatically). The script ``fetch_core.py`` does this. It takes two
parameters, the path of the ``dependencies.yaml`` file, and the directory
in which to check out the core repository. This directory will be created
if it does not exist.
